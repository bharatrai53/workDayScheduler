# workDayScheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler was created so that I could utilize my skills in Bootstrap and JQuery to better understand the syntax of these new tools within my code. I was also able to further refine my understadning of localStorage by saving and retrieving items from the localStorage. Lastly, I was able to integrate the DayJs Library to get the current time and use it as a comparator in some functions as well. The time scheduler is a useful tool that can be used to help manage tasks and create a list of items to accomplish by the end of the day. 

## Usage
When you type text in a row and select the save icon you will be able to save your to do item and it will not disappear if you refresh the page. The color of each row block is defined based on the current time of the day. The hours of the past will appear as gray, the color of the present will be red, and the colors of the future rows will be green so that you can keep track of the day as it progresses.
